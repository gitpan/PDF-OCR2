INSTALL - install help from scratch
DESCRIPTION
    This document helps install PDF::OCR2 and like modules.

    Perl is not the fastest medium- but it is convenient. As of this
    writing, I work in a small accounting firm. We have a small IT
    department that maintains a number of projects that make life easier- if
    not just bearable, for human beings. I am able to maintain some fairly
    decent and useful projects. Most are relatively complex- and without
    perl, I would not be able to do so.

    One of the the things I've worked on a are a set of perl modules to
    facilitate interaction with ocr engines. PDF::OCR2 allows you to get
    text out of a pdf document, and if there is not text, we call an ocr
    engine to do work for us. This has proven invaluable at my office. We
    can look inside the many thousands of documents without altering them in
    any way.

    I have received various emails for help on installing PDF::OCR2,
    Image::OCR::Tesseract, etc. The inquiries vary from 'will it work on
    windows?' to 'why won't it install?'

    This document contains the most common answers to these questions.

MAKE SURE YOU ARE READY TO INSTALL
    You will need a decent computer and operating system. You will need root
    access, access to cpan via command line, possibly a package management
    system such as aopt-get, yum, etc. You will be compiling a thing or two
    from source.

  posix operating system
    You need a posix operating system. These are unixes and linuxes.

    I've had excellent results installing on Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu
    servers.

  hardware
    I can't stress enough how much imaging procedures will abuse hardware.
    Memory is not very important. The cpu, however.. Is very important.

    I would not suggest a production server of anything less than a 1.2Ghz
    machine. Overall, I get good results on 64bit architecture vs 32bit.

    Ideally speaking, I would have access to a IBM mainframe- but- I don't.
    The best I get my hands on recently are dual core pentium IVs, they're
    really not bad. If your company or organization is willing to devote a
    beefy server to manage ocr and imaging tasks, great. Otherwise, the
    aforementioned machines will do well.

  cpan, up to date
    A lot of the requirements here are perl modules. You will be using cpan
    via the command line. Having command line cpan access seems pretty
    standard, I've never seen a unix box without it.

    Old cpan commands worked as:

       cpan install Module::Name

    New cpan commands look like:

       cpan Module::Name

    You can update cpan by saying:

       cpan install CPAN

  root access
    The installation procedures in this document assume you are logged in as
    root.

   ubuntu, enabling root access
    By default, on ubuntu, the root account is disabled. It is suggested you
    enable root access. I understand the reasoning- personally- I don't like
    sudo. It seems they've disabled it by simply not providing a password
    for the root account. How 'clever'.

    As of Ubuntu version 8.04, you need to enable root access by providing a
    root password for the account.

       $ sudo passwd root

    It will ask you for what you want as password.

INSTALL NON PERL DEPENDENCIES
  gcc-c++ and automake
   fedora
       $ yum install -y gcc-c++
       $ yum install -y automake

   ubuntu
       $ apt-get install gcc-c++
       $ apt-get install automake

  imagemagick
   fedora
       $ yum install -y imagemagick

   ubuntu
       $ apt-get install imagemagick

  tesseract
    Installing tesseract can be tricky. I don't know of a rpm or debian
    package for this one. You'll very likely have to install this from
    source. Make sure you have gcc-c++ and automake installed on your
    system- id you don't know you can proceed, but if you suffer any errors,
    simple go back, install gcc-c++ and automake, and try again.

    You may be able to simply install the SVN version of tesseract this way:

       $ cd /tmp
       $ svn checkout http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
       $ cd tesseract-ocr
       $ ./runautoconf
       $ mkdir build-directory
       $ cd build-directory
       $ ../configure
       $ make
       $ make install

    For more info, see google project on ocr, they use tesseract.

INSTALL PERL MODULES
    Ideally, you could simply say:

       cpan PDF::OCR2

    And, voila- done. And potentially, this might work. If no, I suggest to
    install perl modules in following similar order..

   perl modules install order
       $ cpan PDF::API2
       $ cpan CAM::PDF
       $ cpan PDF::Burst
       $ cpan PDF::GetImages 
       $ cpan Image::OCR::Tesseract
       $ cpan PDF::OCR2

   Image::OCR::Tesseract
    If the command 'cpan Image::OCR::Tesseract' fails.. You will need to
    download the package and install manually from distro.

       $ cd /tmp
       $ wget http://search.cpan.org/src/LEOCHARRE/Image-OCR-Tesseract-1.22/
       $ tar -xvf Image-OCR-T(tab completion)
       $ cd Image-OCR-T(tab completion)
       $ perl Makefile.PL # or you can do perl t/00(tab completion)

    This will check for image libraries and ocr engine. You will need to
    have already installed imagemagick and tesseract, as mentioned in this
    document.

    Make sure you are getting the latest version of Image::OCR::Tesseract,
    the above example is for version 1.22. I update frequently- so make
    sure. You can search for the latest version by going to
    http://search.cpan.org and search for 'Image::OCR::Tesseract'.

    There are INSTALL.* readme files in the package Image::OCR::Tesseract
    that may want to look through.

   Image::Magick
    Should already be available ( via previously installing imagemagick ).

BUGS
    I am very open to corrections, suggestions, hints, tips, criticism. I am
    not a know-it-all, I have been able to do and share some useful things
    because of what I learn every day from my peers. Please contact the
    AUTHOR.
